Discord Bot with Authentication
Description
This Discord bot is designed to respond to a !hello command, requiring an authentication token. The authentication is implemented through a MySQL database, and the bot utilizes the Discord.py library for interaction with the Discord API.

Features
Authentication: The !hello command requires an authentication token, which is validated against a MySQL database.
Database Connection: The bot establishes a connection to a MySQL database for storing and retrieving authentication tokens.

Setup

MySQL Database:
Ensure that you have a MySQL server running.
Create a database named cbot.
Update the MySQL connection details in the script (host, user, password) with your database credentials.

Discord Bot:
Create a Discord bot on the Discord Developer Portal.
Copy the bot token and replace the placeholder token in the script.
Dependencies:

Install the required Python libraries:
pip install discord mysql-connector-python

Run the Bot:
Execute the script to run the Discord bot:
python your_script_name.py

Usage
Invite the bot to your Discord server.
Use the !hello command with an authentication token to receive a personalized greeting.

Additional Notes
Handle exceptions gracefully, especially when working with external services like databases.
Keep sensitive information (tokens, passwords) secure and avoid hardcoding them directly into scripts.
